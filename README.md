# Makino Project

This repository contains the **Makino project**, developed with Jupyter notebooks.  
The initiative is focused on **reducing downtime for Makino machines** through data-driven insights and machine learning models.  
Models such as **Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes** are implemented and compared to determine the best-performing approach for improving operational efficiency.
